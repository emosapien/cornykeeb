# Emosapien's 'Corny' keeb layout adventure

Built a TyperactiveXYZ Corne kit with lowpro choc switches and impossible matte white keys.
I'm a terrible typist on a work issued Thinkpad 9-5 for the last decade. This is my attempt at trying something new. Maybe fun. Definitely maddening.

The firmware for the keyboard is modified by forking a github repo with an action sequence that processes the configuration files when the repo is updated to create files for the keyboard to ingest.

This is that repo.

## Objectives

- Make a QWERTY 3x5+3 layout
- Use homerow mods
- Use layers to group additional functions and keys
- identify and implement macros and shortcuts for my use
  
## Tools

I am using a web based editor to configure my keymapping. I can then process this repo with the drawing util to create a png of my layout for reference. ZMK and Typeractive docs included as they were my jumping off point.

## Layers
There are four extra layers in addition to the default layer. Describe layers as they are configured.

### Qwerty
The default layer mostly your alphas. Use of homerow mods in CAGS-SGAC configuration.

### SPCNAV

### MEDNUM

### GFUNCT
